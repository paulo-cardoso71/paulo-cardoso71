### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Full Stack Software Engineer** with **5+ years of experience** in IT, specializing in bridging the gap between complex backend architectures and pixel-perfect frontend interfaces.

My background in **C#/.NET Engineering** gave me a strong foundation in **Clean Architecture and System Design**, which I now apply to the modern **Node.js & React ecosystem**. I don't just write code; I build reliable, scalable "growth engines" for businesses.

* 🔭 **Currently working on:** Advanced AI Agents & Next.js 15 Architectures.
* 🌱 **Learning:** Three.js for 3D Web Experiences.
* ⚡ **Philosophy:** "If there’s a problem, there’s a way to solve it."
